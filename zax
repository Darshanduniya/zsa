Subject: Request to Reconfigure PostgreSQL Tablespace After NAS Migration

Hi Team,

During our previous activity, we had created a tablespace for PostgreSQL and pointed it to /mpd/staging instead of the default /var directory.

However, after the recent NAS share migration, the configuration has reverted. Currently, the PostgreSQL data directory is pointing back to /var/lib/pgsql/14/data/.

Could you please reconfigure the tablespace to point to /mpd/staging again for both the servers mentioned below?

Reference: SR527858

Servers:

lnx5504.ch3.dev.i.com

lnx5534.ch3.prod.i.com

Thank you for your support.
